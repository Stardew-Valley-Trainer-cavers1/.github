## 🧠 What Is a Stardew Valley Trainer?

A **trainer** is an external program that injects memory-based hacks into Stardew Valley while it's running. Unlike mods, trainers don’t require a mod loader — they just sit in the background and **change values in real-time** with keybinds or switches.

💡 Perfect for quick boosts or players who want max freedom without modding their game files.
